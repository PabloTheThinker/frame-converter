# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots for the README.md file.

## Required Screenshots

Please add the following screenshots to this folder:

1. **main-window.png** - Screenshot of the main application window with the drag & drop zone
2. **settings.png** - Screenshot of the settings dialog showing all options
3. **dark-mode.png** - Screenshot of the application in dark mode

## How to Take Screenshots

### On Pop!_OS / Ubuntu

1. Press `PrtSc` to take a screenshot of the entire screen
2. Press `Alt + PrtSc` to take a screenshot of the current window
3. Press `Shift + PrtSc` to select an area to screenshot

Screenshots are saved to `~/Pictures/Screenshots/` by default.

### Tips for Good Screenshots

- Use a clean, uncluttered desktop background
- Take screenshots at a reasonable resolution (1920x1080 is ideal)
- Ensure the application is fully visible and not cut off
- For dark mode, switch the theme in Settings first
- Consider adding a sample video file to show in the file list

## Updating README

Once you've added the screenshots, make sure the filenames match exactly:
- `main-window.png`
- `settings.png`
- `dark-mode.png`

The README.md already references these files!
